abstract = {When avoiding a group, a walker has two possibilities: either he goes through it or around it. Going through very dense groups or around huge ones would not seem natural and could break any sense of presence in a virtual environment. This paper aims to enable crowd simulators to handle such situations correctly. To this end, we need to understand how real humans decide to go through or around groups. As a first hypothesis, we apply the Principle of Minimum Energy (PME) on different group sizes and density. According to this principle, a walker should go around small and dense groups whereas he should go through large and sparse groups. Such principle has already been used for crowd simulation; the novelty here is to apply it to decide on a global avoidance strategy instead of local adaptations only. Our study quantifies decision thresholds. However, PME leaves some inconclusive situations for which the two solutions paths have similar energetic costs. In a second part, we propose an experiment to corroborate PME decisions thresholds with real observations. As controlling the factors of an experiment with many people is extremely hard, we propose to use Virtual Reality as a new method to observe human behavior. This work represents the first crowd simulation algorithm component directly designed from a VR-based study. We also consider the role of secondary factors in inconclusive situations. We show the influence of the group appearance and direction of relative motion in the decision process. Finally, we draw some guidelines to integrate our conclusions to existing crowd simulators and show an example of such integration. We evaluate the achieved improvements.},

abstract = {The modern study of a crowd as a flowing continuum is a recent de-velopment. Distinct from a classical fluid because of the property that a crowd has the capacity to think, interesting new physical ideas are involved in its study. An appeal-ing property of a crowd in motion is that the nonlinear, time-dependent, simultaneous equations representing a crowd are conformably mappable. This property makes many interesting applications analytically tractable. In this review examples are given in which the theory has been used to provide possible assistance in the annual Muslim Hajj, to understand the Battle of Agincourt, and, surprisingly, to locate barriers that actually increase the flow of pedestrians above that when there are no barriers present. Modern developments may help prevent some of the approximately two thousand deaths that annually occur in accidents owing to crowding.The field of crowd mo-tion, that is, the field of " thinking fluids, " is an intriguing area of research with great promise.},

@article{Zitouni2016,
abstract = {Visual recognition of crowd dynamics has had a huge impact on several applications including surveillance, situation awareness, homeland security and intelligent environments. However, the state-of-the-art in crowd analysis has become diverse due to factors such as: (a) the underlying definition of a crowd, (b) the constituent elements of the crowd processing model, (c) its application, hence (d) the dataset and (e) the evaluation criteria available for benchmarking. Although such diversity is healthy, the techniques for crowd modelling thus developed have failed to establish credibility therefore becoming unreliable and of questionable validity across different research disciplines. This paper aims to give an account of such issues by deducing key statistical evidence from the existing literature and providing recommendations towards focusing on the general aspects of techniques rather than any specific algorithm. The advances and trends in crowd analysis are drawn in the context of crowd modelling studies published in leading journals and conferences over the past 7 years. Finally, this paper shall also provide a qualitative and quantitative comparison of some existing methods using various publicly available crowd datasets to substantiate some of the theoretical claims.},

abstract = {Currently, pedestrian simulation models are used to predict where, when and why hazardous high density crowd movements arise. However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research.This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},
