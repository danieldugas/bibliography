abstract = {As robots make their way into our everyday lives, new behavioral concepts are needed to assure their acceptance as interaction partners. In the presence of humans, robots are required to take safety as well as human comfort into account. This paper presents a novel, planning-based approach for social robot navigation. It uses predicted human trajectories and a social cost function to plan collision-free paths that take human comfort into account. It furthermore employs time dependent, kinodynamic path planning to reason about human motion over time and to account for the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a robot. Our approach generates paths that exhibit properties similar to those used in human-human interaction, such as waiting for a human to pass before continuing along an intended path, avoiding getting too close to another human's personal space, and moving out of the way when blocking a human's path. In extensive experiments carried out with real robots and in simulation we demonstrate the performance of our approach.},

abstract = {We present a real-time algorithm, SocioSense, for socially-aware navigation of a robot amongst pedestrians. Our approach computes time-varying behaviors of each pedestrian using Bayesian learning and Personality Trait theory. These psychological characteristics are used for long-term path prediction and generating proximic characteristics for each pedestrian. We combine these psychological constraints with social constraints to perform human-aware robot navigation in low- to medium-density crowds. The estimation of time-varying behaviors and pedestrian personalities can improve the performance of long-term path prediction by 21{\%}, as compared to prior interactive path prediction algorithms. We also demonstrate the benefits of our socially-aware navigation in simulated environments with tens of pedestrians.},

abstract = {— This paper reports on a data-driven motion plan-ning approach for interaction-aware, socially-compliant robot navigation among human agents. Autonomous mobile robots navigating in workspaces shared with human agents require motion planning techniques providing seamless integration and smooth navigation in such. Smooth integration in mixed scenarios calls for two abilities of the robot: predicting actions of others and acting predictably for them. The former requirement requests trainable models of agent behaviors in order to accurately forecast their actions in the future, taking into account their reaction on the robot's decisions. A human-like navigation style of the robot facilitates other agents—most likely not aware of the underlying planning technique applied—to predict the robot motion vice versa, resulting in smoother joint navigation. The approach presented in this paper is based on a feature-based maximum entropy model and is able to guide a robot in an unstructured, real-world environment. The model is trained to predict joint behavior of heterogeneous groups of agents from onboard data of a mobile platform. We evaluate the benefit of interaction-aware motion planning in a realistic public setting with a total distance traveled of over 4 km. Interestingly the motion models learned from human-human interaction did not hold for robot-human interaction, due to the high attention and interest of pedestrians in testing basic braking functionality of the robot.},

@inproceedings{Kirby2009,
abstract = {This paper introduces the COMPANION framework: a constraint-optimizing method for person-acceptable navigation. In this framework, human social conventions, such as personal space and tending to one side of hallways, are represented as constraints on the robot's navigation. These constraints are accounted for at the global planning level. In this paper, we present the rationale for, and implementation of, this framework, and we describe the experiments we have run in simulation to verify that the method produces human-like behavior in a mobile robot. Our approach is novel in that it can express an arbitrary number of social conventions and explicitly accounts for these conventions in the planning phase.},

@inproceedings{Pandey2010,
abstract = {For a Mobile Robot to navigate in the Human-Centered environment without imposing alien like impression by its motion, it should be able to reason about various criteria ranging from clearance, environment structure, unknown objects, social conventions, proximity constraints, presence of an individual or group of peoples, etc. Also the robot should neither be over-reactive nor be simple wait and move machine. We have adapted a Voronoi diagram based approach for the analysis of local clearance and environment structure. We also propose to treat human differently from other obstacles for which the robot constructs different sets of regions around human and iteratively converges to a set of points (milestones), using social conventions, human proximity guidelines and clearance constraints to generate and modify its path smoothly. Once equipped with such capabilities, robot is able to do higher-level reasoning for dynamic and selective adaptation of social convention depending upon the environment segment. It also leads the robot to be aware about its own motion behavior.},

abstract = {We consider mobile robot navigation in dense human crowds. In particular, we explore two questions. Can we design a navigation algorithm that encourages humans to coop- erate with a robot?Would such cooperation improve navigation performance? We address the first question by developing a probabilistic predictive model of cooperative collision avoid- ance and goal-oriented behavior by extending the interacting Gaussian processes approach to include multiple goals and stochastic movement duration. We answer the second question with an extensive quantitative study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs completed), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance.We find that the “multiple goal” interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd den- sities near 1 person/m2, while a state of the art noncooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than 3 times as often as this multiple goal extension, and more than twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian processes. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used “dynamic window” approach fails for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. Based on these experimental results, and previous theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is important for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds. I.},
