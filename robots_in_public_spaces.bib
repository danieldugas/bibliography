abstract = {This paper describes the software architecture of an autonomous tour-guideltutor robot. This robot was recently deployed in the "Deutsches Museum Bonn," were it guided hundreds of visitors through the museum during a six-day deployment period. The robot's control software integrates low-level probabilistic reasoning with high-level problem solving embedded in first order logic. A collection of software innovations, described in this paper, enabled the robot to navigate at high speeds through dense crowds, while reliably avoiding collisions with obstacles--some of which could not even be perceived. Also described in this paper is a user interface tailored towards non-expert users, which was essential for the robot's success in the museum. Based on these experiences, this paper argues that time is ripe for the development of AI-based commercial service robots that assist people in everyday life.},

abstract = {Recently introduced RGB-D cameras are capable of providing high quality synchronized videos of both color and depth. With its advanced sensing capabilities, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase the capabilities of object recognition. It also raises the problem of developing expressive features for the color and depth channels of these sensors. In this paper we introduce hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP) for RGB-D data. HMP uses sparse coding to learn hierarchical feature representations from raw RGB-D data in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments on various datasets indicate that the features learned with our approach enable superior object recognition results using linear support vector machines.},

abstract = { This paper summarizes a long-term project to install and maintain socially interactive, autonomous mobile robots in public spaces. We have deployed four robots over the past five years, accumulating a total operational time exceeding seven years. This document introduces the robots, then focuses on lessons learned from each deployment. Finally, this paper describes how this entire project came to a close, offering a cautionary tale for those who wish to embark on such an effort in the future.},

Minerva's software is pervasively probabilistic, relying on explicit representations of uncertainty in perception and control. During 2 weeks of operation, the robot interacted with thousands of people, both in the museum and through the Web, traversing more than 44km at speeds of up to 163 cm/sec in the unmodified museum.},

abstract = {Rackham is an interactive robot-guide that has been used in several places and exhibitions. This paper presents its design and reports on results that have been obtained after its deployment in a permanent exhibition. The project is conducted so as to incrementally enhance the robot functional and decisional capabilities based on the observation of the interaction between the public and the robot. Besides robustness and efficiency in the robot navigation abilities in a dynamic environment, our focus was to develop and test a methodology to integrate human-robot interaction abilities in a systematic way. We first present the robot and some of its key design issues. Then, we discuss a number of lessons that we have drawn from its use in interaction with the public and how that will serve to refine our design choices and to enhance robot efficiency and acceptability},

The aim of the architecture is to integrate visual perception and actions with knowledge representation, in order to let the robot to generate a deep inner understanding of its environment. The principled integration of perception, action and of symbolic knowledge is based on the introduction of an intermediate representation based on G{\"{a}}rdenfors conceptual spaces. The architecture has been tested on a RWI B21 autonomous robot on tasks related with guided tours in the Archaeological Museum of Agrigento.
