abstract = {Casual encounters with mobile robots for nonexperts can be a challenge due to lack of an interaction model. The present work is based on the rules from proxemics which are used to design a passing strategy. In narrow corridors the lateral distance of passage is a key parameter to consider. An implemented system has been used in a small study to verify the basic parametric design for such a system. In total 10 subjects evaluated variations in proxemics for encounters with a robot in a corridor setting. The user feedback indicates that entering the intimate sphere of people is less comfortable, however a too significant avoidance is also considered unnecessary. Adequate signaling of avoidance is a behaviour that must be carefully tuned},

abstract = { This paper explores the problem of embodied interaction between a service robot and a person in a hallway setting. For operation in environments with people that have limited experience with robots, a behaviour that signals awareness of the persons and safety of motion is essential. A control strategy based on human spatial behaviour studies is presented that adopts human-robot interaction patterns similar to those used in person-person encounters. The results of a pilot study with human subjects are presented in which the users have evaluated the acceptability of the robot behaviour patterns during passage with respect to three basic parameters: the robot speed, the signaling distance at which the robot starts the maneuver and the lateral distance from the person for safe passage. The study has shown a good overall user response and has provided some useful indications on how to design a hallway passage behaviour that could be most acceptable to human users.},

abstract = {This paper presents the combined results of two studies that investigated how a robot should best approach and place itself relative to a seated human subject. Two live Human Robot Interaction (HRI) trials were performed involving a robot fetching an object that the human had requested, using different approach directions. Results of the trials indicated that most subjects disliked a frontal approach, except for a small minority of females, and most subjects preferred to be approached from either the left or right side, with a small overall preference for a right approach by the robot. Handedness and occupation were not related to these preferences. We discuss the results of the user studies in the context of developing a path planning system for a mobile robot},

@inproceedings{Shi2008,
abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how high-speed robots may move among humans such that the robots complete their tasks efficiently while the humans in the environment feel safe and comfortable. It describes the Segway robotic platform used for this research and then discusses the three primary research areas needed to develop the human-aware motion planner. First, it is necessary to conduct experiments with humans to develop human aware velocity constraints as a function of the distance of the robot from a human. Next, these velocity constraints must be used to plan the robot motion in real time. Finally, practical implementation of this motion planner requires the ability to robustly detect humans using the available vision sensors. The approach taken to each of these problems is described in this paper along with preliminary results.},

abstract = {It is envisioned that in the near future personal mobile robots will be assisting people in their daily lives. An essential characteristic shaping the design of personal robots is the fact that they must be accepted by human users. This paper explores the interactions between humans and mobile personal robots, by focusing on the psychological effects of robot behavior patterns during task performance. These behaviors include the personal robot approaching a person, avoiding a person while passing, and performing non-interactive tasks in an environment populated with humans. The level of comfort the robot causes human subjects is analyzed according to the effects of robot speed, robot distance, and robot body design, as these parameters are varied in order to present a variety of behaviors to human subjects. The information gained from surveys taken by 40 human subjects can be used to obtain a better understanding of what characteristics make up personal robot behaviors that are most acceptable to the human users.},

abstract = {Interestingly in different situations, human not only plans differently for approaching, accompanying, passing by and avoiding another person, but also smoothly maintains an appropriate distance. But for a mobile robot it is not trivial at all, while also maintaining its goal. In this paper we present a generic framework of mobile robot path planning for adapting social rules at different states of execution, which apart from assuring safety, also respects the comfort and expectations of human, and convey its intention to human well in advance. In our approach for treating human explicitly robot constructs different sets of regions around human and iteratively converges to a set of points (milestones), using social rules, human proximity rules and task oriented rules to generate a smooth path. We have compared our results with the case, when robot is purely reactive.},

@inproceedings{Walters2011,
abstract = {A long-term Human-Robot Proxemic (HRP) study was performed using a newly developed Autonomous Proxemic System (APS) for a robot to measure and control the approach distances to the human participants. The main findings were that most HRP adaptation occurred in the first two interaction sessions, and for the remaining four weeks, approach distance preferences remained relatively steady, apart from some short periods of increased distances for some participants. There were indications that these were associated with episodes where the robot malfunctioned, so this raises the possibility of users trust in the robot affecting HRP distance. The study also found that approach distances for humans approaching the robot and the robot approaching the human were comparable, though there were indications that humans preferred to approach the robot more closely than they allowed the robot to approach them in a physically restricted area. Two participants left the study prematurely, stating they were bored with the repetitive experimental procedures. This highlights issues related to the often incompatible demands of keeping experimental controlled conditions vs. having realistic, engaging and varied HRI trial scenarios.},

abstract = {As robots enter the everyday physical world of people, it is important that they abide by society's unspoken social rules such as respecting people's personal spaces. In this paper, we explore issues related to human personal space around robots, beginning with a review of the existing literature in human-robot interaction regarding the dimensions of people, robots, and contexts that influence human-robot interactions. We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N=30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) x 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design.},
