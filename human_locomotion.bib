abstract = {In the kinematic realm, wheeled robot's determining characteristic$\backslash$nlies in its nonholonomic constraint. Indeed, the wheels of the robot$\backslash$nunequivocally force the robot vehicle to move tangentially to its$\backslash$nmain axis. Here we test the hypothesis that human locomotion can$\backslash$nalso be partly described by such a nonholonomic system. This hypothesis$\backslash$nis inspired by the trivial observation that humans do not walk sideways:$\backslash$nsome constraints of different natures (anatomical, mechanical{\ldots}) may$\backslash$nrestrict the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model$\backslash$nthese constraints, we propose a simple differential system satisfying$\backslash$nthe so called rolling without sliding constraint. We validated the$\backslash$nproposed model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded)$\backslash$ntrajectories obtained from goal-oriented locomotion of human subjects.$\backslash$nThese subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction$\backslash$nin space and cross over to a distant porch so that both initial and$\backslash$nfinal positions and directions were controlled. A comparative analysis$\backslash$nwas successfully undertaken by making use of numerical methods to$\backslash$ncompute the control inputs from actual trajectories. To achieve this,$\backslash$nthree body segments were used as local reference frames: head, pelvis$\backslash$nand torso. The best simulations were obtained using the last body$\backslash$nsegment. We therefore suggest an analogy between the steering wheels$\backslash$nand the torso segment, meaning that for the control of locomotion,$\backslash$nthe trunk behavior is constrained in a nonholonomic manner. Our approach$\backslash$nallowed us to successfully predict 87 percent of trajectories recorded$\backslash$nin seven subjects and might be particularly relevant for future pluridisciplinary$\backslash$nresearch programs dealing with modeling of biological locomotor behaviors.},

abstract = {The movement of pedestrians is supposed to show certain regularities which can be best described by an ``algorithm'' for the individual behavior and is easily simulated on computers. This behavior is assumed to be determined by an intended velocity, by several attractive and repulsive effects and by fluctuations. The movement of pedestrians is dependent on decisions, which have the purpose of optimizing their behavior and can be explicitly modelled. Some interesting applications of the model to real situations are given, especially to formation of groups, behavior in queues, avoidance of collisions and selection processes between behavioral alternatives.},
