abstract = {The paper describes a navigation algorithm for dynamic, uncertain environment. Moving obstacles are supposed to move on typical patterns which are pre-learned and are represented by Gaussian processes. The planning algorithm is based on an extension of the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm, where the likelihood of the obstacles trajectory and the probability of collision is explicitly taken into account. The algorithm is used in a partial motion planner, and the probability of collision is updated in real-time according to the most recent estimation. Results show the performance of the navigation algorithm for a car-like robot moving among dynamic obstacles with probabilistic trajectory prediction.},

abstract = {In order to effectively plan paths in environments inhabited by humans, robots must accurately predict human motion. Typical approaches to human prediction simply assume a constant velocity which is not always valid. This paper proposes to determine the likely navigation intent of humans and use that to predict human motion. Navigation intent is determined by the function and structure of the environment. Manually assigned functional places are combined with automatically extracted navigation way-points to define a number of likely navigation targets within the environment. To predict human motion toward these targets, a probabilistic model of human motion is proposed which is based on motion probability grids generated from observed motion. The models of human navigation intent and motion are integrated with an autonomous mobile robot system, with a laser range sensor detecting humans moving within the environment, and a path planning system. The models of human navigation intent and motion are verified using real captured human motion data from an office environment. Examples of human motion prediction are also presented.},

abstract = {We consider mobile robot navigation in dense human crowds. In particular, we explore two questions. Can we design a navigation algorithm that encourages humans to cooperate with a robot? Would such cooperation improve navigation performance? We address the first question by developing a probabilistic predictive model of cooperative collision avoidance and goal-oriented behavior by extending the interacting Gaussian processes approach to include multiple goals and stochastic movement duration. We answer the second question with an extensive quantitative study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (488 runs completed), specifically testing how cooperation models effect navigation performance. We find that the ``multiple goal'' interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities near 1 person/m2, while a state of the art noncooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than 3 times as often as this multiple goal extension, and more than twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian processes. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used ``dynamic window'' approach fails for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m2. Based on these experimental results, and previous theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is important for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.},

abstract = {Object tracking typically relies on a dynamic model to predict the object's location from its past trajectory. In crowded scenarios a strong dynamic model is particularly important, because more accurate predictions allow for smaller search regions, which greatly simplifies data association. Traditional dynamic models predict the location for each target solely based on its own history, without taking into account the remaining scene objects. Collisions are resolved only when they happen. Such an approach ignores important aspects of human behavior: people are driven by their future destination, take into account their environment, anticipate collisions, and adjust their trajectories at an early stage in order to avoid them. In this work, we introduce a model of dynamic social behavior, inspired by models developed for crowd simulation. The model is trained with videos recorded from birds-eye view at busy locations, and applied as a motion model for multi-people tracking from a vehicle-mounted camera. Experiments on real sequences show that accounting for social interactions and scene knowledge improves tracking performance, especially during occlusions.},

This setting is useful in applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be difficult to write down an explicit reward function specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover the expert's reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to the expert's unknown reward function.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new trajectory planning algorithm for virtual humans. Our approach focuses on implicit cooperation between multiple virtual agents in order to share the work of avoiding collisions with each other. Specifically, we extend recent work on multi-robot planning to better model how humans avoid collisions by introducing new parameters that model human traits, such as reaction time and biomechanical limitations. We validate this new model based on data of real humans walking captured by the Locanthrope project $\backslash$[12$\backslash$]. We also show how our model extends to complex scenarios with multiple agents interacting with each other and avoiding nearby obstacles.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is to enable mobile robots to navigate through crowded environments such as indoor shopping malls, airports, or downtown side walks. The key research question addressed in this paper is how to learn planners that generate human-like motion behavior. Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn human-like navigation behavior based on example paths. Since robots have only limited sensing, we extend existing IRL methods to the case of partially observable environments. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic crowd flow simulator in which we modeled multiple scenarios in crowded environments. We show that our planner learned to guide the robot along the flow of people when the environment is crowded, and along the shortest path if no people are around.},

In the last years human$\backslash$textendash{\{}{\}}robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.},

abstract = {The vision-based mechanisms that pedestrians in social groups use to navigate in dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles and each others, have been subject to a large amount of research in social anthropology and biological sciences. We build on recent results in these fields to develop a novel fully-distributed algorithm for robot local navigation, which implements the same heuristics for mutual avoidance adopted by humans. The resulting trajectories are human-friendly, because they can intuitively be predicted and interpreted by humans, making the algorithm suitable for the use on robots sharing navigation spaces with humans. The algorithm is computationally light and simple to implement. We study its efficiency and safety in presence of sensing uncertainty, and demonstrate its implementation on real robots. Through extensive quantitative simulations we explore various parameters of the system and demonstrate its good properties in scenarios of different complexity. When the algorithm is implemented on robot swarms, we could observe emergent collective behaviors similar to those observed in human crowds.},

abstract = {Whenever people move through their environments they do not move randomly. Instead, they usually follow specific trajectories or motion patterns corresponding to their intentions. Knowledge about such patterns enables a mobile robot to robustly keep track of persons in its environment and to improve its behavior. In this paper we propose a technique for learning collections of trajectories that characterize typical motion patterns of persons. Data recorded with laser-range finders are clustered using the expectation maximization algorithm. Based on the result of the clustering process, we derive a hidden Markov model that is applied to estimate the current and future positions of persons based on sensory input. We also describe how to incorporate the probabilistic belief about the potential trajectories of persons into the path planning process of a mobile robot. We present several experiments carried out in different environments with a mobile robot equipped with a laser-range scanner and a camera system. The results demonstrate that our approach can reliably learn motion patterns of persons, can robustly estimate and predict positions of persons, and can be used to improve the navigation behavior of a mobile robot.},

abstract = {The ability to act in a socially-aware way is a key skill for robots that share a space with humans. In this paper we address the problem of socially-aware navigation among people that meets objective criteria such as travel time or path length as well as subjective criteria such as social comfort. Opposed to model-based approaches typically taken in related work, we pose the problem as an unsupervised learning problem. We learn a set of dynamic motion prototypes from observations of relative motion behavior of humans found in publicly available surveillance data sets. The learned motion prototypes are then used to compute dynamic cost maps for path planning using an any-angle A* algorithm. In the evaluation we demonstrate that the learned behaviors are better in reproducing human relative motion in both criteria than a Proxemics-based baseline method.},

abstract = {In order to act socially compliant with humans, mobile robots need to show several behaviors that require the prediction of people's motion. For example, when a robot avoids a person, it needs to respect the human's personal space $\backslash$[1$\backslash$] and the avoidance behavior needs to be smooth, so that it is understandable to the interaction partner. To achieve this, the robot needs to reason about future paths a person is likely to follow. Because humans adapt their avoidance behavior to the robot's motion, the proposed method performs lifelong learning of the people's behavior while it adapts its own behavior to their motion. The human avoidance behavior is modeled by a discrete, multi-modal, spatio-temporal distribution over the people's future occurrences. This prediction is based on the people's positions and their velocities relatively to the robot and the obstacle situation of the robot's environment. The proposed prediction method is significantly better than a simple linear prediction. Particularly, for tactical decisions, like whether to avoid a moving person on the left or on the right side, this approach is well suited. Furthermore, when the humans get used to a robot, also a long-term change of the human behavior towards the robot can be learned by our approach.},

abstract = {Vehicle navigation in dynamic environments is an important challenge, especially when the motion of the objects populating the environment is unknown. Traditional motion planning approaches are too slow to be applied in real-time to this domain, hence, new techniques are needed. Recently, iterative planning has emerged as a promising approach. Nevertheless, existing iterative methods do not provide a way to estimating the future behaviour of moving obstacles and to use the resulting estimates in trajectory computation. This paper presents an iterative planning approach that addresses these two issues. It consists of two complementary methods: 1) A motion prediction method which learns typical behaviours of objects in a given environment. 2) An iterative motion planning technique based on the concept of Velocity Obstacles.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin.},

abstract = {In order to effectively plan paths in environments inhabited by humans, robots must accurately predict human motion. Typical approaches to human prediction simply assume a constant velocity which is not always valid. This paper proposes to determine the likely navigation intent of humans and use that to predict human motion. Navigation intent is determined by the function and structure of the environment. Manually assigned functional places are combined with automatically extracted navigation way-points to define a number of likely navigation targets within the environment. To predict human motion toward these targets, a probabilistic model of human motion is proposed which is based on motion probability grids generated from observed motion. The models of human navigation intent and motion are integrated with an autonomous mobile robot system, with a laser range sensor detecting humans moving within the environment, and a path planning system. The models of human navigation intent and motion are verified using real captured human motion data from an office environment. Examples of human motion prediction are also presented.},

abstract = {Simulated annealing$\backslash$textemdash{\{}{\}}moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions$\backslash$textemdash{\{}{\}}has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

Optimal control inputs and constraints in velocity space are formally derived for the non-holonomic robots. The theoretical results are validated in several collision avoidance experiments with up to fourteen e-puck robots set on collision course. Even in scenarios with very crowded situations, NH-ORCA showed to be collision-free for all times.},

abstract = {This paper presents a real-time path planning algorithm that guarantees probabilistic feasibility for autonomous robots with uncertain dynamics operating amidst one or more dynamic obstacles with uncertain motion patterns. Planning safe trajectories under such conditions requires both accurate prediction and proper integration of future obstacle behavior within the planner. Given that available observation data is limited, the motion model must provide generalizable predictions that satisfy dynamic and environmental constraints, a limitation of existing approaches. This work presents a novel solution, named RR-GP, which builds a learned motion pattern model by combining the flexibility of Gaussian processes (GP) with the efficiency of RRT-Reach, a sampling-based reachability computation. Obstacle trajectory GP predictions are conditioned on dynamically feasible paths identified from the reachability analysis, yielding more accurate predictions of future behavior. RR-GP predictions are integrated with a robust path planner, using chance-constrained RRT, to identify probabilistically feasible paths. Theoretical guarantees of probabilistic feasibility are shown for linear systems under Gaussian uncertainty; approximations for nonlinear dynamics and/or non-Gaussian uncertainty are also presented. Simulations demonstrate that, with this planner, an autonomous vehicle can safely navigate a complex environment in real-time while significantly reducing the risk of collisions with dynamic obstacles.},

For safety assessment, the overall collision probability is used to rank candidate trajectories by considering the probability of colliding with known objects as well as the estimated collision probability beyond the planning horizon. In addition, we introduce a safety assessment cost metric, the probabilistic collision cost, which considers the relative speeds and masses of multiple moving objects in which the robot may possibly collide with. The collision probabilities with other objects are estimated by probabilistic reasoning about their future motion trajectories as well as the ability of the robot to avoid them. The results are integrated into a navigation framework that generates and selects trajectories that strive to maximize safety while minimizing the time to reach a goal location. An example implementation of the proposed framework is applied to simulation scenarios, that explores some of the inherent computational trade-offs.},

We formulate the problem as planning a minimal cost trajectory through a potential field, defined from the perceived position and motion of persons in the environment. A Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed as a solution to the planning problem, and a new method for selecting the best trajectory in the RRT, according to the cost of traversing a potential field, is presented. The RRT expansion is enhanced to account for the kinodynamic robot constraints by using a robot motion model and a controller to add a reachable vertex to the tree. Instead of executing a whole trajectory, when planned, the algorithm uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, where only a short segment of the trajectory is executed while a new iteration of the RRT is computed. The planning algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated pedestrian street environment.},

abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory planning algorithm for a robot operating in dynamic human environments. Environments such as pedestrian streets, hospital corridors, train stations or airports. We formulate the problem as planning a minimal cost trajectory through a potential field, defined from the perceived position and motion of persons in the environment. A Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed as a solution to the planning problem, and a new method for selecting the best trajectory in the RRT, according to the cost of traversing a potential field, is presented. The RRT expansion is enhanced to account for the kinodynamic robot constraints by using a robot motion model and a controller to add a reachable vertex to the tree. Instead of executing a whole trajectory, when planned, the algorithm uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, where only a short segment of the trajectory is executed while a new iteration of the RRT is computed. The planning algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated pedestrian street environment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a formal approach to reciprocal n-body collision avoidance, where multiple mobile robots need to avoid collisions with each other while moving in a common workspace. In our formulation, each robot acts fully independently, and does not communicate with other robots. Based on the definition of velocity obstacles $\backslash$[5$\backslash$], we derive sufficient conditions for collision-free motion by reducing the problem to solving a low-dimensional linear program. We test our approach on several dense and complex simulation scenarios involving thousands of robots and compute collision-free actions for all of them in only a few milliseconds. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first that can guarantee local collision-free motion for a large number of robots in a cluttered workspace.},

abstract = {In this work, a framework for motion prediction of vehicles and safety assessment of traffic scenes is presented. The developed framework can be used for driver assistant systems as well as for autonomous driving applications. In order to assess the safety of the future trajectories of the vehicle, these systems require a prediction of the future motion of all traffic participants. As the traffic participants have a mutual influence on each other, the interaction of them is explicitly considered in this framework, which is inspired by an optimization problem. Taking the mutual influence of traffic participants into account, this framework differs from the existing approaches which consider the interaction only insufficiently, suffering reliability in real traffic scenes. For motion prediction, the collision probability of a vehicle performing a certain maneuver, is computed. Based on the safety evaluation and the assumption that drivers avoid collisions, the prediction is realized. Simulation scenarios and real-world results show the functionality.},

Obtaining good results typically requires carefully hand-engineering the trade-offs between different terms in the cost function. In practice, it is often much easier to demonstrate a few good trajectories. In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm which - when given access to a few trajectory demonstrations - can automatically infer good trade-offs between the different costs. In our experiments, we apply our algorithm to the problem of navigating a robotic car in a parking lot.},

abstract = {Obstacle avoidance, and by extension collision checking, is a basic requirement for robot autonomy. Most classical approaches to collision-checking ignore the uncertainties associated with the robot and obstacle's geometry and position. It is natural to use a probabilistic description of the uncertainties. However, constraint satisfaction cannot be guaranteed, in this case, and collision constraints must instead be converted to chance constraints. Standard results for linear probabilistic constraint evaluation have been applied to probabilistic collision evaluation; however, this approach ignores the uncertainty associated with the sensed obstacle. An alternative formulation of probabilistic collision checking that accounts for robot and obstacle uncertainty is presented which allows for dependent object distributions (e.g., interactive robot-obstacle models). In order to efficiently enforce the resulting collision chance constraints, an approximation is proposed and the validity of this approximation is evaluated. The results presented here have been applied to robot-motion planning in dynamic, uncertain environments.},

abstract = {This work presents a novel approach for collision assessment for automotive environments. As collision prevention and risk analysis are key challenges for today's intelligent transport systems, sophisticated solutions for a collision-free trajectory generation get indispensable. The presented collision checker is integrated into an optimal control based planning framework that generates minimum jerk trajectories for arbitrary maneuvers. In contrast to common collision checkers, the developed method does not need to discretize the time space, but gives an algebraic solution which covers nearly all situations and has a constant response time. Due to its fast evaluation it is predestined for use in a Monte Carlo simulation respecting the probabilistic nature of real world traffic scenes. An example implementation of the proposed method is applied to simulation scenarios that demonstrates the benefits to comparable approaches. The obtained results have proven the feasibility of our approach to risk analysis of traffic situations.},

abstract = {Simulated annealing$\backslash$textemdash{\{}{\}}moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions$\backslash$textemdash{\{}{\}}has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

@phdthesis{Trautman2013a,
abstract = {This thesis explores the problem of mobile robot navigation in dense human crowds. We begin by considering a fundamental impediment to classical motion planning algorithms called the freezing robot problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing predictive uncertainty by employing higher fidelity individual dynamics models or heuristically limiting the individual predictive covariance to prevent overcautious navigation. We demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the individual predictive uncertainty have little to do with this undesirable navigation behavior. Additionally, we provide evidence that dynamic agents are able to navigate in dense crowds by engaging in joint collision avoidance, cooperatively making room to create feasible trajectories. We accordingly develop interacting Gaussian processes, a prediction density that captures cooperative collision avoidance, and a "multiple goal" extension that models the goal driven nature of human decision making. Navigation naturally emerges as a statistic of this distribution.

Most importantly, we empirically validate our models in the Chandler dining hall at Caltech during peak hours, and in the process, carry out the first extensive quantitative study of robot navigation in dense human crowds (collecting data on 488 runs). The multiple goal interacting Gaussian processes algorithm performs comparably with human teleoperators in crowd densities nearing 1 person/m$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\}}, while a state of the art noncooperative planner exhibits unsafe behavior more than 3 times as often as the multiple goal extension, and twice as often as the basic interacting Gaussian process approach. Furthermore, a reactive planner based on the widely used dynamic window approach proves insufficient for crowd densities above 0.55 people/m$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\}}. We also show that our noncooperative planner or our reactive planner capture the salient characteristics of nearly any dynamic navigation algorithm. For inclusive validation purposes, we show that either our non-interacting planner or our reactive planner captures the salient characteristics of nearly any existing dynamic navigation algorithm. Based on these experimental results and theoretical observations, we conclude that a cooperation model is critical for safe and efficient robot navigation in dense human crowds.

Finally, we produce a large database of ground truth pedestrian crowd data. We make this ground truth database publicly available for further scientific study of crowd prediction models, learning from demonstration algorithms, and human robot interaction models in general.

To achieve accurate activity forecasting, our approach models the effect of the physical environment on the choice of human actions. This is accomplished by the use of state-of-the-art semantic scene understanding combined with ideas from optimal control theory. Our unified model also integrates several other key elements of activity analysis, namely, destination forecasting, sequence smoothing and transfer learning. As proof-of-concept, we focus on the domain of trajectory-based activity analysis from visual input. Experimental results demonstrate that our model accurately predicts distributions over future actions of individuals.

Human motion prediction is gaining importance since this helps minimizing the hinder robots cause during the execution of these tasks. The concept of social forces defines virtual repelling and attracting forces from and to obstacles and points of interest. These social forces can be used to model typical human movements given an environment and a person's intention. This work shows how such models can exploit typical motion patterns summarized by growing hidden Markov models (GHMMs) that can be learned from data online and without human intervention. An extensive series of experiments shows that exploiting a person's intended position estimated using a GHMM within a social forces based motion model yields a significant performance gain in comparison with the standard constant velocity-based models.},

abstract = {The paper presents a navigation algorithm for dynamic probabilistic environments. The static environment is unknown; moving pedestrians are detected and tracked on-line. Pedestrians are supposed to move along typical motion patterns represented by HMMs. The planning algorithm is based on an extension of the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm, where the likelihood of the obstacles future trajectory and the probability of collision is explicitly taken into account. The algorithm is used in a partial motion planner, and the probability of collision is updated in real-time according to the most recent estimation. Results show the performance for a car-like robot in a simulated environment among multiple dynamic obstacles.},

abstract = {This paper presents a strategy for planning robot motions in dynamic, uncertain environments (DUEs). Successful and efficient robot operation in such environments requires reasoning about the future evolution and uncertainties of the states of the moving agents and obstacles. A novel procedure to account for future information gathering (and the quality of that information) in the planning process is presented. To approximately solve the stochastic dynamic programming problem that is associated with DUE planning, we present a partially closed-loop receding horizon control algorithm whose solution integrates prediction, estimation, and planning while also accounting for chance constraints that arise from the uncertain locations of the robot and obstacles. Simulation results in simple static and dynamic scenarios illustrate the benefit of the algorithm over classical approaches. The approach is also applied to more complicated scenarios, including agents with complex, multimodal behaviors, basic robot-agent interaction, and agent information gathering.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the use of social behavior models for the prediction of a pedestrian's future motion. Recently, such models have been shown to outperform simple constant velocity models in cases where data association becomes ambiguous, e.g. in case of occlusion, bad image quality, or low frame rates. However, to account for the multiple alternatives a pedestrian can choose from, one has to go beyond the currently available deterministic models. To this end, we propose a stochastic extension of a recently proposed simulation-based motion model. This new instantiation can cater for the possible behaviors in an entire scene in a multi-hypothesis approach, using a principled modeling of uncertainties. In a set of experiments for prediction and template-based tracking, we compare it to a deterministic instantiation and investigate the general value of using an advanced motion prior in tracking.},
